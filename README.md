# 🏛️ EU Digital Building Stock Model (DBSM R2025)

The **EU Digital Building Stock Model (DBSM)** provides a detailed and comprehensive and homogeneous **geospatial database of individual buildings** across the European Union. While primarily focused on **energy-related characteristics**, the model supports a broad range of applications.DBSM enables bottom-up solutions from individual building level to entire neighborhoods and national scales.

This initiative aims to support major EU energy policies—such as the **Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)**—by enabling **data-driven, targeted investment decisions** in line with the **EU Renovation Wave**. DBSM also supports the **European Affordable Housing Initiative** by enabling high-resolution "**what-if**" analyses and assessments.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains four scripts that replicate the **conflation** process of **DBSM R2025** and estimate the **rooftop PV potential** at building level:

### 🔹 `step0`: Conflation Core (DBSM R2025)
This is the core script of the DBSM pipeline.

**Inputs required (per country):**
- [`EUBUCCO`](https://eubucco.com)
- [`OpenStreetMap`](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
- [`Microsoft Building Footprints`](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints)

**Main tasks:**
- Validates and repairs input geometries
- Reprojects all layers to **EPSG:3035**
- Merges building datasets into a harmonized layer

---

### 🔹 `step1`: Postprocessing
Cleans and filters the merged building layer:
- Detects and removes **duplicate and overlapping buildings**
- Removes **false positives** and buildings <5 m²
- Flags buildings overlapping **water or forest parcels**

---

### 🔹 `step2`: Attribute Assignment & Cleanup
Prepares the building layer for analysis:
- Assigns a **unique building ID**
- Removes duplicate geometries
- Harmonizes the attribute table
- Computes basic descriptive statistics

🔗 External processing required:
Use the [**JRC Building Data Integrator**](https://code.europa.eu/jrc-ghsl/building-data-integrator) to enrich buildings with:
- Height  
- Use  
- Shape factor  
- Construction epoch

---

### 🔹 `step3`: Rooftop PV Potential Estimation
- Estimates **rooftop PV potential** at the **building level**
- Outputs country-level results as `.gpkg`
